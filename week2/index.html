                <p>The recent launches of the James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) and the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) by NASA and its international partners are excellent reminders that the universe emits light or energy in many different forms. <br/></p >
                <p>To fully investigate cosmic objects and phenomena, scientists need telescopes that can detect light across what is known as the electromagnetic spectrum. <br/></p >
                <p>This gallery provides examples of the ways that different types of light from telescopes on the ground and in space can be combined. <br/></p >
                <p>The common thread in each of these selections is data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, illustrating how X-rays — which are emitted by very hot and energetic processes — are found throughout the Universe. </p >
                <P>Alma TV, regarded as Italy's leading national television channel, broadcast the gala live for the first time, reached 25 million households in Italy. The program was also aired for the first time on Canada's Xinflix Media and Charming China online channel, attracting 220,000 views.  </P>
